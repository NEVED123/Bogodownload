# Welcome to Bogodownload

Not everyone _gets_ bogodownload. They just say "What's the point?" and "Are you trying to give my computer a virus??" Rest assured, we here at Bogodownload Inc. Have only the best of the best of intentions. In fact, Bogodownload is the revolutionary way to download files, without even having to be connected to the internet.

## How it works

Bogodownload harnesses the power of [Bogosort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogosort) to create the file that you want to download. There are an infinite number of universes ([potentially](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiverse)), but a finite number of files that can be randomly generated. Therefore, there is a non-zero chance that the file you are after will be downloaded. Actually, there is a greater chance that it will generate a file you didn't ask for, but that will revolutionize the world. You could get the cure for cancer, the answer to all of life's questions, and who knows what else! There's only one way to find out ðŸ˜Ž
